# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains several health-related attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The dataset includes the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 or 1, where 1 indicates diabetes)

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow of the project.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebook)

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
